    <string name="instructions">
        This app is meant to map the coverage of TTN gateways. It will monitor packets received from a node,
        plotting the location of the packets on a map. The signal strength is indicated by a colour,
        creating a heatmap of the coverage.

        \n\nThis app will use your phone\'s GPS to determine the location where a packet was sent from.
        The LoRa node therefore needs to be as close as possible to your smartphone.

        \n\nEnter your TTN MQTT details below, and then tap on start.</string>
